        <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
        <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to the gradual warming of the planet.</p>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
        <p>1. Burning Fossil Fuels: The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation releases large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.<br>
           2. Deforestation: Cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that absorb CO2, leading to higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br>
           3. Deforestation: Cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that absorb CO2, leading to higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br>
           4. Agricultural Practices: Livestock farming, rice paddies, and the use of fertilizers emit methane and nitrous oxide.<br>
           5. Waste Management: Landfills and waste treatment facilities produce methane as organic waste decomposes.</p>

    <section id="effects">
        <h2>Effects of Global Warming</h2>
        <p>1. Rising Temperatures: Average global temperatures have been increasing, leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves.<br>
           2. Melting Ice Caps and Glaciers: The melting of polar ice caps and glaciers contributes to rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities.<br>
           3. Extreme Weather Events: Global warming is linked to an increase in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods.<br>
           4. Loss of Biodiversity: Climate change disrupts ecosystems, leading to habitat loss and endangering plant and animal species.<br>
           5. Ocean Acidification: The absorption of CO2 by the oceans leads to increased acidity, harming marine life like coral reefs and shellfish.</p>

    <section id="solutions">
        <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
        <p>1. Reduce Carbon Emissions: Transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, and improve energy efficiency in transportation and buildings.<br>
           2. Protect Forests: Support reforestation efforts and sustainable forest management practices to preserve carbon sinks.<br>
           3. Adapt and Mitigate: Develop strategies to adapt to the impacts of climate change and implement policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
           4. Promote Sustainable Agriculture: Adopt practices that reduce emissions from agricultural activities and improve soil health.<br>
           5. Raise Awareness: Educate others about the importance of addressing global warming and advocate for climate action at local, national, and international levels.</p>
